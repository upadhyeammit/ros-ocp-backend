# Notification codes

Every ROS recommendation can include **notification codes**: small integers that explain
*why* a row looks the way it does (low confidence, idle workload, orphaned PVC, and so on).
Use this page as a single lookup for **all 69 codes** across containers, namespaces, nodes,
GPUs, PVCs, snapshots, and virtual machines.

**Maintainer reference** (emitters, constants, migrations): `docs/architecture/notification-codes.md` in the repository.

## How notifications appear in the API

| Resource | List / detail fields | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Containers, namespaces, nodes, PVCs, snapshots | `notification_codes` (array) and `notifications` (map keyed by code string) | Map entries include `type`, `message`, `code` (Kruize-compatible shape) |
| Virtual machines | `notifications` (JSON array) | `type` is lowercase: `info`, `warning`, `critical` |

Example (container):

```json
"notification_codes": [1, 3],
"notifications": {
  "1": { "type": "WARNING", "message": "Less than 4 days of data available for this workload", "code": 1 },
  "3": { "type": "CRITICAL", "message": "OOM kill events detected within the analysis window", "code": 3 }
}
```

**Severity** (for badges and alerts):

| API `type` | Meaning | Suggested UI |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| `CRITICAL` / `critical` | Immediate risk or failure signal | Error / danger badge |
| `WARNING` / `warning` | Review before acting; possible waste or bottleneck | Warning badge |
| `INFO` / `info` | Context or opportunity; often informational | Info badge |

**No cost data (code 25):** Hide dollar savings (`$0.00` is misleading). Show “—” and link to
[Cost integration](cost-integration.md). Fleet summary treats clusters with only code-25 recs as
having no actionable savings.

## By feature

### Containers and idle detection

Codes **1–9**, **21–22** (reserved), **25**. See [Container recommendations](../features/container-recommendations.md)
and [Idle / zombie detection](../features/idle-detection.md).

- Prefer `idle_state` (`active` / `idle` / `zombie`) over inferring from codes **5** and **8** alone.
- Code **2** (stale) means the cluster is not sending fresh ROS metrics — not the same as idle.
- Code **3** (OOM) should drive memory increases before cost-only downsizing.

### Namespaces

Codes **1**, **2**, **7**, **9** only (namespace sizing plugin). See [Namespace recommendations](../features/namespace-recommendations.md).

| Code | Name | Message |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | `LOW_CONFIDENCE` | Less than 4 days of data available for this workload |
| 2 | `STALE_DATA` | No new metrics data received for more than 48 hours |
| 7 | `NEW_WORKLOAD` | Less than 24 hours of data — recommendation may be unstable |
| 9 | `MEMORY_TRENDING_UP` | Memory usage trend suggests capacity risk within 30 days |

Namespace-level memory trend uses a higher slope threshold than containers (500 KiB/day vs 100 KiB/day).
ResourceQuota codes **70–72** are documented under the [quota plugin](../plugin-reference/quota.md), not here.

### Nodes

Codes **11–13**, **25**, plus reserved **4**, **14–17**, **23–24**. See [Node consolidation](../features/node-recommendations.md).

### GPU (containers) and time-slicing

Codes **10**, **26–28**, **36**. See [GPU MIG](../features/gpu-mig.md) and [GPU time-slicing](../features/gpu-time-slicing.md).

### PVCs

Codes **20**, **25**, **29**, **30**. See [PVC right-sizing](../features/pvc-rightsizing.md).
Always show `resize_note` for oversized PVCs — Kubernetes cannot shrink volumes in place.

### Snapshots

Codes **31–35**. See [Snapshot staleness](../features/snapshot-staleness.md).

### Virtual machines

Codes **18–19**, **37–69**. Full VM notification table also appears in
[Virtual machine recommendations](../features/virtual-machines.md#placement-and-numa).
Abandoned VMs use **43** only (not **18**). Power-off scheduling: **64** (`is_power_off_candidate`,
`power_off_idle_pct`) when mostly idle with occasional activity — not abandoned. Network QoS hints:
**65** (SR-IOV), **66** (DPDK) when `is_network_bound` — see [Network QoS hints](../features/virtual-machines.md#network-qos-hints-6566).
Storage tiering hints: **67**–**69** from multi-day disk I/O — see [Storage tiering hints](../features/virtual-machines.md#storage-tiering-hints-6769).
Placement flags:
`is_redundant_placement` (**60**), `has_shared_storage` (**62**), `numa_oversized` (**63**).

### Quotas

**ResourceQuota** and **ClusterResourceQuota** plugins do not emit notification codes today.

## UI integration

For badge mapping, fleet tiles, and filter hints, see [UI integration guide](../ui-integration-guide.md)
(Section 16 — notification codes). After backend changes, flush API cache and hard-refresh the browser.

---

## Catalog endpoint

`GET /api/cost-management/v1/recommendations/openshift/notification-codes` (when enabled) returns
rows from `notification_code_definitions`. Until then, use this page or query the database table
for machine-readable `name`, `severity`, and `description` fields.
